^^^^^^

* Admin now displays pretty names for the setting keys.
* `StaticFilesChoiceField` and `DefaultStorageFilesChoiceField` now both use an
  LRU cache to avoid having to enumerate the storage backends/finders repeatedly.


0.4.1
^^^^^^

* When generating a form from an ``OrderedDict``, field ordering is now preserved.
* When a form's values are saved into the database and become stale (because the
  underlying form/defaults are added to), the new defaults are transparently
  mapped onto the value when it's made available via the middleware,
  context processor or template tag.


0.4.0
^^^^^^

* Introduced the ``stagesetting`` template tag.
* Settings are no longer automatically created on app ``ready()``, instead
  the defaults are lazily converted when requested via a ``RuntimeSettingWrapper``
* Added ``StaticFilesChoiceField`` and ``DefaultStorageFilesChoiceField``,
  which allow for selecting a file that already exists in the given storage.
* When auto-generating a form, the ``STATIC_URL`` and ``MEDIA_URL`` settings
  are treated as special, and turned into the aforementioned fields.
* Providing an incomplete defaults dictionary in the second parameter of a
  given setting's config will now show *Info* messages to indicate what's
  missing.
* When auto-generating a form from a dictionary, HTML-like values will try
  to use one of `django-ckeditor`_, `django-tinymce`_, `django-markdown`_,
  `django-pagedown`_, or `django-epiceditor`_ for a widget instead of a normal
  ``textarea``.
* Added support for using `django-bleach`_ when encountering HTML-like values
  in an autogenerated form.
* Added initial support for `djangorestframework`_


0.3.2
^^^^^^

* Fixed error introduced in ``0.3.1`` when only providing a dictionary, because
  it turns out it wasn't being covered by tests.

0.3.1
^^^^^^

* Fixed issue where providing a dictionary wasn't treating the values as
  implicit defaults to be created into the database.


0.3.0
^^^^^^

* Added ability to auto-generate forms for configuration values which are
  dictionaries.

0.2.0
^^^^^^

* Initial release.
